Documentation
=============
The document The_Cerro_Paranal_Advanced_Sky_Model.pdf 
(ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/dfs/pipelines/skytools/skymodel/The_Cerro_Paranal_Advanced_Sky_Model.pdf)
provides a guide to users who want to obtain detailed information on the basic structure and physical
background of the skymodel.

In addition to that, the document The_Cerro_Paranal_Advanced_Sky_Model_User_Manual.pdf 
(ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/dfs/pipelines/skytools/skymodel/The_Cerro_Paranal_Advanced_Sky_Model_User_Manual.pdf)
includes descriptions of the procedures for software installation and execution,
the individual code segments (called modules) and the incorporated external software.


Disclaimer
===========
The skymodel was developed for Cerro Paranal and an adaptation to other
sites is not straightforward and may require significant user efforts.
The assistance from ESO is restricted to the explanation of the site dependence of
the different model components as given in the documentation, see section 9.3 document
The_Cerro_Paranal_Advanced_Sky_Model_User_Manual.pdf 
(ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/dfs/pipelines/skytools/skymodel/The_Cerro_Paranal_Advanced_Sky_Model_User_Manual.pdf).

===============
The web application SkyCalc http://www.eso.org/observing/etc/skycalc/skycalc.htm
provides an interface to obtain models of transmission and radiance spectra in
physical units, calculated on ESO servers with this model for
configurable observation configurations and conditions.

Command-line interface (CLI)
A programmatic interface to SkyCalc skycalc_cli is available, please see
